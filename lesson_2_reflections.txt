What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates a metadata file that will begin to store all of
your commits to the involved files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers a 'cache' of sorts that allows you to commit only certain files, not necessarily everything
in the working directory.
